          Distributive focuses on next generation distributed computing and the
          parallelization of complex problems. They work alongside the
          scientific computing field, hospitals, and more, all to leverage
          distributed computing and make this process fast and efficient.
          Located in Kingston Ontario, I'm privileged to have worked here in
          person as a Software Developer for my first work term going into third
          year.
        </h5>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <h5>
          I created 3 goals this work term that revolved around leadership as
          well as problem solving. These included:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Learn how the in's and out's of the DCP (Distributed Compute
              Protocol) functions which would allow me to debug, implement
              features, and solve problems easier. This will result in knowing
              exactly where something went wrong and figure out the solutions
              with minimal guidance when it comes to discovering/fixing bugs,
              writing tests, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Work on my leadership skills even while being a new intern without
              any previous experience. I want to be able to act as a leader and
              show the existing developers that I can be counted on when it
              comes to working on the codebase. I also want to make sure that I
              can answer most of the questions that the other interns might have
              which will allow them to grow/mature while I do.
            </li>
            <li>
              Expand my knowledge of the JavaScript language as well as Node.js
              as these two are the backbones of the DCP technology. I want to
              build off of the knowledge I already know and start to focus on
              more advanced topics of JavaScript that the DCP uses in their
              codebase. By doing this, I'm not only broadening my personal
              understanding of the languages and specific techniques used with
              them, but I'm also benefiting the companies I may work for in the
              future that use the same technologies.
            </li>
          </ul>
          Reflections
          <ul>
            <li>
              I was able to contribute heavily to the codebase even with sparse
              experience working in a bigger codebase like this. Along with
              another intern, we created an application that utilized DCP and
              showcased it to our management and peers. This allowed us to be
              more confident working with the technologies and understanding
              them thoroughly. Overall, I was able to learn a lot about
              developing software and contributed over 30 PR's to the codebase.
              Overall, I worked really hard and despite it being my first work
              term, I developed a lot of new features and fixed certain issues
              throughout the codebase.
            </li>
            <li>
              I was able to onboard within a day and because of that, assist my
              peers with their on-boarding or any other questions they had. I
              also started contributing to the codebase early on which allowed
              me to grasp an understanding of proper coding conventions and the
              whole PR process. I passed this knowledge down to the other
              interns when it was their time to do the same. To showcase more
              leadership, I even created a small event on Friday's where
              developers would get together and solve algorithm problems in a
              certain amount of time in order for everyone to sharpen their
              skills but still have fun at the same time. Overall, I felt like a
              leader during my work term and it allowed me to be more confident
              as a developer.
            </li>
            <li>
              I achieved this goal because since our codebase was written in
              JavaScript, I forced myself to learn it thoroughly even though I
              had previous experience with the language. I had even learned new
              things about it throughout my time developing. I also learned how
              to properly use a debugger and what it means to have one at all
              times whether you are writing software or debugging it. I heavily
              used these techniques and did not have experience using them
              prior. Overall, the way I fixed bugs and wrote software saw an
              increase in efficiency after working at this company.

          <h5>
            While working at Distributive, I co-developed a Ray-Tracing engine
            that utilized DCP and was able to get a working product showcased in
            front of my peers and supervisor. I also implemented new database
            functionalities as well as implemented a new compute cluster
            mechanism. This would allow further growth for the company and have
            multiple computers on different compute groups to do work. I also
            did some front-end UI work in React.js for the company's new portal
            page. Looking back, I was able to learn more about Node.js, SQL,
            compute clusters, React.js, and much more. I also learned a lot of
            new skills that I would not have come across in school. These
            include debugging tools, how to contribute to an existing codebase,
            how to make a PR, how to adhere to coding standards/styles, etc.
            This was an amazing learning experience as I got to work with tools
            and frameworks that I had never seen before and that broadened my
            understanding of the industry.
          </h5>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <h5>
          These past four months at Distributive truly shaped me as a developer
          and I'm grateful to have contributed to their codebase. Their product
          is very innovative and something that their target audience gets a lot
          of use out of. I admired the fast-paced environment of the startup and
          appreciated the "always learning" mentality where no matter what, I
          was always learning something new.
