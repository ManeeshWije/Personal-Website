			<h1>Why I Hate Javascript</h1>
			<p>Written by Maneesh Wijewardhana, June 6 2021</p>

			<h6>I wanna start off with saying that no I don't actually hate Javascript. The capabilities of it are too long to even list out in a blog post. However, as a dynamically typed language, it has more quirks that some may be comfortable with.</h6>
			<br />
			<h2>Dynamic vs Loosely(Statically) Typed</h2>
			<h6>Javascript is very loosely typed which means that for example, you don't have to tell a string that it is a string.</h6>
			<pre>
<code class="language-js">
	let x = "hello";
	x = 1;
	console.log(x);
</code>
</pre>
			<h6>
				The same way as per not needing to define a variable with a different datatype later on in the program. What this means for the programmer is that they give you a lot of flexibility and let you move faster in the code. You'll be able to change things quickly and without any type
				errors. The problem with this approach is the fact that it opens up more doors for errors and security malfunctions. This is due to having no compiler before running Javascript. A compiler such as gcc can detect errors at compile time rather than at runtime which makes the testing
				phase for a programmer slightly easier. In C, we have types and a compiler that needs to run through our code to check for errors. Here's an example of one.
			</h6>

			<pre>
<code class="language-clike">
	int main() { 
		int num = 1; 
		num = "hello"; 
		printf("%d", num); 

		return 0;
	}
</code>
</pre>
			<h6>
				If you run this code, the compiler will spit out an error saying we cannot assign num as a string when its datatype initially was an integer. C also specifies you to tell the compiler what datatype it is that you want to print to the console. All of these checks are what make C a
				more secure language, albeit, more verbose. As a Javascript developer, you have to be extra careful when working with different datatypes and functions or else during runtime, you would have to debug more often than not.
			</h6>
			<br />
			<h2>The Web in 2021</h2>
			<h6>
				Another point I want to make is that no matter what stream of programming you go into, it's no secret that the world runs on the web. More specifically, web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, React, Angular, Node.js, and so many more. All of these tools implement Javascript in one way
				or another. What this means is that you would have to learn Javascript no matter what and it seems as though most SWE roles look for that skill by default. It sucks for some people who have no interest in the web and only want to write scripts or what not. You can counter this by
				saying "well I'm just gonna go into backend development or machine learning". At the rate the web is growing and more front-end frameworks become mainstream, the more Javascript will grow and become a necessity for all.
			</h6>
			<br />
			<h2>Uh Hello...Typescript</h2>
			<h6>
				Some counter arguments to what I have said so far might be to just use Typescript and yes, that is correct. Typescript is the greatness of Javascript, but with types! Now you can catch errors such as the one from our C example very quickly. However, I am a sucker for vanilla
				Javascript and the simplicity of it at times just outweigh trying to use Typescript. Although I will say that if I were working on a large project with multiple peers, it would make sense to use Typescript just so the codebase is cleaner and easy to debug.
			</h6>
			<br />
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<h6>
				To be fair, you could say these problems are just minor caveats of the language just as how there are minor caveats in every language ever written(except maybe Haskell:P). I myself love Javascript. It's what I use on a day to day basis whether that be coding a new web app to solving
				algorithm questions. That just goes to show how versatile Javascript really is and how anyone should pick it up to learn at some point in their career. In conclusion, no, I don't hate Javascript.
